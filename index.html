Pass by Reference:
Pass by reference (also called pass by address) means to pass
the reference of an argument in the calling function to the
corresponding formal parameter of the called function so that a
copy of the address of the actual parameter is made in
memory, i.e. the caller and the callee use the same variable for
the parameter. If the callee modifies the parameter variable, the
effect is visible to the caller’s variable.


Overview:
1. Passes an argument by 
reference.
2. Callee gives a direct reference 
to the programming element in 
the calling code.
3. The memory address of the 
stored data is passed.
4. Changes to the value have an 
effect on the original data.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
void swap(int &a, int &b)
{
int c=a;
a=b;
b=c;
cout<<"The value in submodule
:"<<a<<" "<<b<<endl;
}
int main()
{
int x=30,y=35;
cout<<"b4 swapping: "<<x<<" 
"<<y<<endl;
swap(x,y);
cout<<" After swapping 
:"<<x<<" "<<y<<endl;
return 0;
}

Return by Reference:
Pointers and References in C++ held close relation with one
another. The major difference is that the pointers can be
operated on like adding values whereas references are just
an alias(synonym) for another variable . Functions in C++ can
return a reference as it’s returns a pointer. When function
returns a reference it means it returns a implicit pointer.
Return by reference is very different from Call by reference.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// Function to return as return by reference
int& returnValue(int& x)
{
// Print the address
cout << "x = " << x << " The address of x is “ << &x << endl;
// Return reference
return x;
}
int main( )
{
int a = 20;
int& b = returnValue(a);
// Print a and its address
cout << "a = " << a << " The address of a is “ << &a << endl;
// Print b and its address
cout << "b = " << b << " The address of b is “ << &b << endl;
returnValue(a) = 13;
cout << "a = " << a<< " The address of a is “<< &a << endl;
return 0;
}


String:
C++ has in its definition a way to represent sequence of
characters as an object of class. This class is called std::
string. String class stores the characters as a sequence of bytes
with a functionality of allowing access to single byte
character.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main ( ) 
{ 
string str1 = "Hello"; 
string str2 = "World"; 
string str3; 
int len ; 
// Copy str1 into str3
str3 = str1; 
cout << "str3 : " << str3 << endl; 
// concatenates str1 and str2
str3 = str1 + str2; 
cout << "str1 + str2 : " << str3 << endl;
// total length of str3 after 
concatenation
len = str3.size(); 
cout << "str3.size() : " << len << endl; 
return 0; 
}
